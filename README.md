Computer Vision Experiments

Three compact projects: GrabCut segmentation, FCN segmentation, and a VAE on MNIST.

Task 1 — GrabCut (Assignment_1.ipynb)
Detect people in asm-1.jpg/asm-2.jpg, run cv2.grabCut (iterations 1,3,5), and view masks/overlays.

Task 2 — FCN (Assignment_2.ipynb, fcn_experiments/)
Train FCN-32s/16s/8s with a ResNet/VGG backbone; compare transpose conv vs bilinear upsampling. Results, curves, weights, and summary_table.csv included.

Task 3 — VAE (MNIST) (Assignment_3.ipynb, vae_mnist_outputs/)
Convolutional VAE with latent dims 128 and 256 — train, reconstruct, sample, interpolate, and visualize latent space.
